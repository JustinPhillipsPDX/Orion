# 

**Orion** is a revolutionary, self-sustaining operating system built on a unique, multi-layered language framework. By integrating core system functions, middleware services, and AI-driven user interfaces into distinct yet interdependent layers, **Orion** rethinks OS design for ultimate modularity, backward compatibility, and intelligent system management.

## Features (Planned)
- **Multi-Layered Architecture**: Separates core functions, system services, and application interfaces into distinct layers that update seamlessly.
- **AI-Driven Interaction**: Provides real-time, context-sensitive assistance via voice and text, integrated at every layer.
- **Dynamic File Management**: Replaces traditional folder hierarchies with intelligent, context-based file categorization and access.
- **Custom Unified Language**: At the heart of Orion is our custom language, [**Orion Eos**](https://github.com/JustinPhillipsPDX/OrionEos), which forms the foundation for system-level code, middleware logic, and user interface components. The inaugural implementation of this language is called **Orion Genesis**, marking the first milestone in Orionâ€™s evolution.
- **Adaptive Performance Optimization**: Uses AI to predict and manage CPU, memory, and power needs for efficient resource utilization.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Designed to run on a variety of hardware environments with a focus on long-term maintainability.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- **C++17 or later**
- A C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- CMake (3.10 or higher)
- Git for version control
- [**SeaShell**](https://github.com/JustinPhillipsPDX/SeaShell) (or a similar tool) for installation and build automation

### Build Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JustinPhillipsPDX/Orion.git
   cd Orion
   ```

2. Run the installation script:
   - **Linux/macOS**:
     ```bash
     ./install.sh
     ```
   - **Windows** (in PowerShell):
     ```powershell
     ./install.ps1
     ```

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the setup.
