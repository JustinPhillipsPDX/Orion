# Orion üåå

Orion is a revolutionary, self-sustaining operating system built on a unique, multi-layered language framework. By integrating core system functions, middleware services, and AI-driven user interfaces into distinct yet interdependent layers, Orion rethinks OS design for ultimate modularity, backward compatibility, and intelligent system management.

## Features (Planned)
- **Multi-Layered Architecture**: Separates core functions, system services, and application interfaces into distinct layers that update seamlessly.
- **AI-Driven Interaction**: Provides real-time, context-sensitive assistance via voice and text, integrated at every layer.
- **Dynamic File Management**: Replaces traditional folder hierarchies with intelligent, context-based file categorization and access.
- **Custom Unified Language**: Implements a unique language that spans system-level code, middleware logic, and user interface components.
- **Adaptive Performance Optimization**: Uses AI to predict and manage CPU, memory, and power needs for efficient resource utilization.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Designed to run on a variety of hardware environments with a focus on long-term maintainability.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- **C++17 or later**
- A C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- CMake (3.10 or higher)
- Git for version control
- [SeaShell üêö](https://github.com/JustinPhillipsPDX/SeaShell) (or a similar tool) for installation and build automation

### Build Instructions
